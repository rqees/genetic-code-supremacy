# genetic-code-supremacy
Is the universal genetic code the best one possible? I created this code to evaluate the hypothesis that the universal genetic code is optimized for minimizing codon neighbor distances, which reduces the impact of mutations. This project was part of a first year computational biology class (CSB195) at UofT.
